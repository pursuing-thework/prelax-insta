We all will be going through the journey of data from it's raw form to it's baked. And will explore where exactly data engineers fit in the picture. . .

Data engineers currently don't have a coherent or systematic course. Most people in this position, rather than following a thorough path, got there by learning on the job. My aim towards this page is to help anyone who wants to be a data engineer but doesn't know where to start and where to find resources for the research.
